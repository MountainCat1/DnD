### No Such Thing as High Ground Advantage
- You do not gain advantage or bonuses to attack rolls for being on higher ground.
- Instead, enemies have a harder time harming you, as elevation grants you cover—potentially even full cover (as per RAW cover rules).

### Non-Combat Spells Are Not Meant to Deal Damage
- Spells like Prestidigitation, Thaumaturgy, Minor Illusion, etc. are not intended to deal damage, and they won’t.
- A few valid examples include:
  - Scaring someone so they trip and fall into a pit.
  - Creating an illusion of a floor that makes someone walk into a pit.
- Invalid uses include:
  - Setting someone on fire with Prestidigitation.
  - Deafening someone with Thaumaturgy.

### Remove Curse Does Not Remove Every Curse
- Some curses are too powerful for Remove Curse and instead require Greater Restoration or even a Wish spell to be lifted.
