# Downtime

## Crafting
For the most part, we stick with what's written in the DMG and XGE.
I will just drop here rules for the most commonly wanted to craft item — the healing potion.

### Crafting Time and Cost

The base creation times and costs for healing potions remain the same as in the *Xanathar’s Guide to Everything* rules:

| Potion of Healing | Creation Time | Cost      |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Healing           | 1 day         | 25 gp     |
| Greater Healing   | 1 workweek    | 100 gp    |
| Superior Healing  | 3 workweeks   | 1,000 gp  |
| Supreme Healing   | 4 workweeks   | 10,000 gp |

### Reducing Cost with Gathered Ingredients

An adventurer can reduce the gold cost of crafting by gathering natural ingredients.
- Up to **half of the crafting cost** may be offset in this way.
- Gathering ingredients takes the same amount of time as the crafting process.
- Gathering and crafting are separate activities — both must be completed to produce the potion.

For example, if you gather ingredients for a potion of healing and then craft it, the minimum total time required is **2 days**: one day for gathering, and one for crafting.

### Finding the Right Components

Not every land contains the necessary herbs and minerals needed for potion-making. The availability of ingredients depends heavily on the environment. Gathering requires the character to make **Nature**, **Survival**, and **Perception** checks, in any order.

- A total of **two successful checks** is required to find enough materials for one potion.
- A failed check does not consume time beyond the gathering period.

Use the table below to determine the DC for each check, based on the terrain:

| Location                                                       | DC |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|----|
| Fertile, well-traveled forest rich in diverse medicinal herbs  | 10 |
| Typical woodland where useful plants are less common           | 15 |
| Urban areas with small green spaces, grasslands, or foothills  | 18 |
| Harsh environments like deserts, high crags, or dense cities   | 20 |

A DM may allow advantage or disadvantage on one or more checks depending on the character’s tools, experience, or local knowledge.
