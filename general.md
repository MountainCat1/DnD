### Custom Exhaustion
- Whenever you would normally gain or lose 1 point of exhaustion, you instead gain or lose **2**.
- Drinking a **Potion of Greater Healing** removes **1 exhaustion**.  
- Drinking a **Potion of Superior Healing** removes **2 exhaustion**.
- **Exhaustion Effects:**
    - Each point of exhaustion imposes a **-1 penalty** to
        - Attack Rolls
        - Saving Throws
        - Ability Checks
        - Armor Class (AC) (?)
- At **10 points** of exhaustion, you **die**.
> All rules and features that reference exhaustion automatically use this adjusted scale. Do not double it again.

---

### Getting Downed
- Each time you fall unconscious by dropping to 0 HP, you gain **2 points of exhaustion**.

---

### Flanking
- Flanking only applies when you and an ally are on **opposite sides** of a creature.
- Flanking grants a **+2 bonus to melee attack rolls**.
- Flanking provides **no other benefits**.

### Custom Long Rests (“Safe Rests”)

#### Short Rests
- Function as normal:
    - Take **1 hour**.
    - Can be done anywhere, anytime, and can be interrupted.

#### Long Rests (renamed to **Safe Rests**)
- Take a minimum of **8 hours**.
- Can **only** be taken in a **Safe Place**.

#### Safe Place Requirements:
- An effectively **unlimited supply of food**.
- An effectively **unlimited supply of healing** (e.g., medical facility, magical aid such as stationed druids or clerics).
- **Protection from immediate danger**, such as:
    - Guarded walls
    - A well-barricaded structure
    - A remote and secure location (e.g., mountaintop rarely attacked)

- **Safe Places may become unusable** due to:
    - Depletion of supplies
    - Increased monster activity from player presence

> *Example:* If the party fortifies an abandoned house with food and water, it might provide only two Safe Rests before supplies run out or monsters breach the defenses.

---

### Custom Encumbrance
- Your maximum carry weight is **10 × Strength score** in pounds.
- There are **no penalties** for being over this limit — you simply **cannot carry more**.
- **Pushing, dragging, and lifting** follow the standard (vanilla) rules.

---

### DM Inspiration
- You may only **store one inspiration** at a time.
- You earn inspiration by doing cool or creative stuff, for example:
    - Commiting to strong roleplay
    - Something  reflects your **backstory**, **traits**, **bonds**, **flaws**, or **ideals**
    - Solving problems in unconventional ways
- You can use inspiration to reroll **any roll** (not just d20s):
    - Your own roll
    - Another player’s roll
    - A DM’s roll
    - Including **damage**, **saving throws**, **attack rolls**, **ability checks**, etc.
    - You can choose to use it **after seeing the result**.
- The DM may add inspiration **silently** to your character sheet when deserved.

---

### Custom Scroll Casting
- If the spell is either:
  - Not on your class's spell list, **or**
  - On your class's spell list but **3 or more levels higher** than the highest-level spell you can currently cast,

  → you must succeed on an **Arcana check** to cast it. The DC is based on the spell’s level, ranging from **DC 10 to DC 19**.

- Otherwise, you can cast the spell from the scroll freely, without needing components or a check.
