D&D House Rules

### **Custom Exhaustion**
- Whenever you would normally gain or lose 1 point of exhaustion, you instead gain or lose **2**.
- Drinking a **Potion of Greater Healing** removes **1 exhaustion**.  
- Drinking a **Potion of Superior Healing** removes **2 exhaustion**.
- **Exhaustion Effects:**
    - Each point of exhaustion imposes a **-1 penalty** to:
        - Armor Class (AC)
        - Attack Rolls
        - Saving Throws
        - Ability Checks
- At **10 points** of exhaustion, you **die**.
(All following mentions of exhaustion account for the change in exhaustion gain amount, so do not adjust it x2)

---
### **Getting Downed**
- Each time you fall unconscious by falling to 0 HP you gain 2 points of exhaustion.

---
### **Flanking**
- Flanking only applies when you and an ally are on **opposite sides** of a creature.
- Flanking grants a **+2 bonus to melee attack rolls**.
- Flanking provides **no other benefits**.

### **Custom Long Rests (“Safe Rests”)**
- **Short Rests** function as normal:
    - Take 1 hour.
    - Can be done anywhere, anytime, and can be interrupted.
- **Long Rests** are now referred to as **“Safe Rests”**, with the following changes:
    - Take a minimum of **8 hours**.
    - Can only be taken in a **Safe Place**.
- A **Safe Place** must meet **all** the following conditions:
    - An effectively **unlimited supply of food**.
    - An effectively **unlimited supply of healing** (e.g., medical facility, magical aid like stationed druids or clerics).
    - **Protection from immediate danger**, such as:
        - Guarded walls
        - A well-barricaded structure
        - A remote and secure location (e.g., mountaintop not frequently attacked by creatures like harpies)
- **Safe Places** may become unusable over time due to:
    - **Depletion of resources**
    - **Increased monster activity** due to player presence
    _Example:_ If the party barricades an abandoned house full of food and water, it might only provide **two Safe Rests** due to limited medical supplies or because whatever caused the abandonment notices new activity. The place remains _safe_ until danger directly breaches the barricade.

### **Custom Encumbrance**
- Maximum carry weight is **10 × Strength score** in pounds.  
- There are **no penalties** for carrying weight—if it exceeds the limit, you simply **cannot carry more**.
- **Pushing, dragging, and lifting** follow the standard (Vanilla) rules.

---
### **DM Inspiration**
- You can only **store one inspiration** at a time.
- You earn inspiration by doing something:
    - **Cool or creative**
    - That shows **strong roleplay**
    - That reflects your **backstory**, **personality traits**, **bonds**, **flaws**, or **ideals**
- You can spend inspiration to reroll **any roll**—_not just d20s_.
    - You can choose to use it **after seeing the result**.
    - It can reroll:
        - Your own roll
        - Another player’s roll
        - Even a DM’s roll
        - Examples include **attack rolls**, **saving throws**, **ability checks**, **damage rolls**, etc.
- DM does not announce inspiration, it will be subtly added to your character sheet
