### **Sleep Deprivation**
- At the end of a 24-hour period without sleep, you must succeed on a **DC 15 Constitution saving throw** or suffer **2 levels of exhaustion**.
- For each additional 24 hours without sleep, increase the DC by **5** (DC 20, DC 25, etc.).
- After a **successful long rest**, the DC resets to **10**.

### **Food Requirements**
- A character requires **1 pound of food per day** to stay healthy.
- A character can go **1 full day without food** with no ill effects.
- Eating **half a pound of food** grants **advantage** on the next Constitution saving throw against starvation (see below).

After the first day without food:
- At the end of **each additional day without a full pound of food**, the character must succeed on a **DC 15 Constitution saving throw** or suffer **1 level of exhaustion**.
- Consuming a **full day's worth of food (1 pound)** resets the starvation counter to **zero**.
