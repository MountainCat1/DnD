### Sleep Deprivation
- At the end of a 24-hour period without sleep, you must succeed on a **DC 10 Constitution saving throw** or suffer **2 levels of exhaustion**.
- For each additional 24 hours without sleep, increase the DC by **5** (DC 15, DC 20, etc.).
- After a **successful sleep**, the DC resets to **10**.

---

### Food Requirements
- A character requires **1 pound of food per day** to stay healthy.
- A character can go **1 full day without food** with no ill effects.
- Eating **half a pound of food** grants **advantage** on the next Constitution saving throw against starvation (see below).

After the first day without food:
- At the end of **each additional day without a full pound of food**, the character must succeed on a **DC 15 Constitution saving throw** or suffer **1 level of exhaustion**.
- Consuming a **full day's worth of food (1 pound)** resets the starvation counter to **zero**.

## Invisibility, Darkness, and Hiding
### Invisibility & Darkness

- **Hearing Radius:**
  - Each creature is assumed to have a 60 ft. hearing radius.
  - A creature automatically knows the location of all creatures within that radius unless they are silent and hidden.
- **Attacking an Unseen Target:**
  - A creature in **invisibility**, **magical darkness**, or **full darkness** can still be attacked if within another creature’s hearing radius.
  - Attacks follow the *Attacking an Unseen Target* rule (disadvantage on attack rolls).
  - Spells or features that require seeing the target cannot be used.

- **Movement Through Darkness:**
  - Moving through **magical darkness**, **full darkness**, or while **blinded** counts as *difficult terrain*.

- **When Both Creatures Cannot See Each Other:**
  - RAW: The attacker has both advantage (target is unseen) and disadvantage (cannot see target), which cancel out.
  - **House Rule:** Instead, both creatures have *disadvantage* on attack rolls against each other, representing mutual confusion.

### Hiding

- Rules as written (see [Hiding Reference](https://2014.5e.tools/quickreference.html#bookref-quick,2,hiding)) apply, with these clarifications:

  - An **invisible creature** is considered *heavily obscured*.
  - Invisibility allows hiding without needing cover.
  - The creature must still make a Stealth check to hide.
  - An invisible creature’s location can be detected by noise or tracks it leaves.
  - Being invisible might grant advantage on Stealth checks if other factors also obscure sound or movement.
