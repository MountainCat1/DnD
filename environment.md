### **Sleep Deprivation**
- At the end of a 24-hour period without sleep, you must succeed on a **DC 10 Constitution saving throw** or suffer **2 levels of exhaustion**.
- For each additional 24 hours without sleep, increase the DC by **5** (DC 15, DC 20, etc.).
- After a **successful sleep**, the DC resets to **10**.

---

### **Food Requirements**
- A character requires **1 pound of food per day** to stay healthy.
- A character can go **1 full day without food** with no ill effects.
- Eating **half a pound of food** grants **advantage** on the next Constitution saving throw against starvation (see below).

After the first day without food:
- At the end of **each additional day without a full pound of food**, the character must succeed on a **DC 15 Constitution saving throw** or suffer **1 level of exhaustion**.
- Consuming a **full day's worth of food (1 pound)** resets the starvation counter to **zero**.

    An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense.
For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
    Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.

### **Invisibility and darkness**
- Each creature is assumed to have 60 feet of hearing radius, that creature knows of the location of all creatures within that radius.
- If a creature is invisible, in magical darkness or full darkness, it can still be attacked by another if within the hearing radius, but as per the rules for attacking an unseen target, which means it has a disadvantage on the attack roll.
as well as all features/spells that require a target to be seen do not work.
- Traversing through magical darkness, full darkness, or while blinded counts as difficult terrain.
- If both creatures do not see each other, by RAW the attacker has a disadvantage on the attack roll, but the defender does not have an advantage on the attack roll against the attacker.
At our table, it works so that instead both creatures have a disadvantage on the attack roll against each other, simulating the confusion of not being able to see each other.


### **Hiding**
We use mostly the rules as written so refer to 
- [Quick Reference: [Hiding]](https://2014.5e.tools/quickreference.html#bookref-quick,2,hiding)

Which means that being invisible just allows you to hide without a cover, but you still need to make a stealth check to hide.
Being invisible might grant you an advantage if on top of there are any factors that would make it hard to hear you.
